# Infinite Text File Creator
Funny Python program that infinitely creates text files

This script creates text files worth about 100 MB so it is a little slow, but open the text file and you will see the funny that has been created. The text is copied 100000 times in one file.

Anyways, do whatever you want, change the text, change the number of repeats, then go and have fun with it.
